# Usage

To use it properly, you need to generate a Bearer Token on GitHub at 
https://github.com/settings/tokens

To access the desired user's repositories, you should use the following URL:
[localhost:8080/api/repo?username=USER&bearerToken=TOKEN](localhost:8080/api/repo?username=USER&bearerToken=TOKEN)

where USER is the username and TOKEN is the generated token
